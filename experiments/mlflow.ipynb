    "# MLflow Experiment Tracking with Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is MLflow?\n",
    "\n",
    "**MLflow** is an open-source platform for managing the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle. It is especially useful for tracking experiments in machine learning projects, making sure that your results are reproducible, comparable, and well-documented.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use MLflow for Tracking?\n",
    "\n",
    "In most machine learning workflows, you try out different:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Algorithms or models\n",
    "* Hyperparameters (like `C` in logistic regression)\n",
    "* Data preprocessing strategies\n",
    "* Training/test splits\n",
    "\n",
    "This leads to multiple experiments whose results you need to compare and analyze. MLflow allows you to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Track all these experiments automatically\n",
    "* Log every run's parameters and metrics\n",
    "* Save trained models and artifacts\n",
    "* Visualize results in a web UI\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Benefits of MLflow Tracking\n",

    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "We use a small dataset (`bankdata.csv`) to train a logistic regression classifier. The MLflow tracking API is used to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Log hyperparameters (e.g., regularization strength `C`)\n",
    "* Log evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy)\n",
    "* Save the trained model artifact\n",
    "\n",
    "All runs are recorded and can be viewed with MLflow's UI.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "Install dependencies:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install mlflow scikit-learn pandas\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The input file `bankdata.csv` should have a structure like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "age,job,marital,education,default,balance,housing,loan,contact,...,y\n",
    "58,management,married,tertiary,no,2143,yes,no,unknown,...,no\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* The target column is `y`, indicating the class label.\n",
    "* Categorical features are label-encoded before training.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## Code Breakdown\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Import Libraries\n",

    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Load and Preprocess Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "df = pd.read_csv(\"bankdata.csv\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Label-encode categorical features\n",
    "for col in df.select_dtypes(include=[\"object\"]).columns:\n",
    "    df[col] = LabelEncoder().fit_transform(df[col])\n",
    "\n",
    "X = df.drop(\"y\", axis=1)\n",
    "y = df[\"y\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Train-Test Split\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Start MLflow Run and Train Model\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "C = 0.1\n",
    "with mlflow.start_run():\n",
    "    model = LogisticRegression(C=C, max_iter=1000)\n",
    "    model.fit(X_train, y_train)\n",
    "    acc = accuracy_score(y_test, model.predict(X_test))\n",

    "### 5. Log to MLflow\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    mlflow.log_param(\"C\", C)               # Log hyperparameter\n",
    "    mlflow.log_metric(\"accuracy\", acc)     # Log evaluation metric\n",
    "    mlflow.sklearn.log_model(model, \"model\")  # Log model artifact\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Running the Script\n",
    "\n",
    "Save the code in a Python file, e.g., `train.py`. Then run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python train.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "or run directly in jupyter notebook\n",
    "\n",

    "To launch the MLflow UI:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "mlflow ui\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Access the interface at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Output in MLflow\n",
    "\n",
    "Each run logs:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The hyperparameter `C`\n",
    "* The `accuracy` score\n",

    "\n",
    "You can compare multiple runs directly in the UI.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "* Enable autologging with `mlflow.sklearn.autolog()` to automatically track parameters and metrics\n",
    "* Register the model in the MLflow Model Registry for deployment and lifecycle management\n",
    "* Add model signature and input examples for inference support\n",
